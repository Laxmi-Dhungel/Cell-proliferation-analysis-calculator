This project works like a calculator to analyze the cell proliferation data.
Cell proliferation experiments are conducted to test effectiveness of different drugs or in varying concentrations of single drugs against cells (e.g. cancer cells).
The experiment design for this type of assay includes 96 well plates. Some of the wells on the plate are treated with drugs and some are left untreated (control).
